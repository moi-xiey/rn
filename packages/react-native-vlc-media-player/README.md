# react-native-vlc-media-player

## New feature requests and bug fixes

At the moment I am a bit tied up with other work. As a matter of fact, I don't get much time to develop at all nowadays. But I am more than open to help anyone who wants's to contribute to this repo. And I will be sure to merge any fixes as soon as PR's come up. But if you need someone to fix issues that affect you till I get back to this(ETA Q3 2022), One option is to add a bounty to the following site https://www.bountysource.com/ someone will attend to it.

    }
}

// dependencies ‰∏ãÊ∑ªÂä†ÈÖçÁΩÆ
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:2.0.1'
}
```

## iOS

1. cd to ios
2. run `pod init` (if only Podfile has not been generated in ios folder)
3. add `pod 'MobileVLCKit', '3.3.10'` to pod file **(No need if you are running RN 0.61 and up)**
4. run `pod install` (you have to delete the app on the simulator/device and run `react-native run-ios` again)

## Optional (only for ios)

Enable Bitcode
in root project select Build Settings ---> find Bitcode and select Enable Bitcode

## TODO

1. Android video Aspect ratio and other params do not work (Events are called but all events come through a single event onVideoStateChange but the JS side does not implement it.).

## Got a few minutes to spare? Please help us to keep this repo up to date and simple to use.

#### Our idea was to keep the repo simple, and people can use it with newer RN versions without any additional config.


1. Get a fork of this repo and clone [VLC Media Player test](https://github.com/razorRun/react-native-vlc-media-player-test)
2. Run it for ios and android locally using your fork, and do the changes. (remove this package using ```npm remove react-native-vlc-media-player``` and install the forked version from git hub ```npm i https://git-address-to-your-forked-repo```)
3. Verify your changes and make sure everything works on both platforms. (If you need a hand with testing I might be able to help as well)
4. Send PR.
5. Be happy, Cause you're a Rockstar üåü ‚ù§Ô∏è
